description: "(Work in progress!) The Milky Way takes ~230 Million years to complete one full revolution. This means, the last time the Sun was in this position in Galactocentric coordinates, dinosaurs had just come on the scene. This is a helpful visualization to think about Galactic timescales, but it doesn't tell the full picture.  Imagine that when a person or creature or organism dies, it's soul is anchored in place in Galactocentric coordinates. This program will allow us to visualize the trail of souls left behind in the Earth's wake, from the death of Whitney Houston to the first dinosaurs to the first unicellular organisms."
